            <p>Hello, I am Alicen Bender, a current high school history teacher and a future computer programmer. With my background in education, I have a lot of experience working with people from many backgrounds. As a pc gamer, my curiousity and desire to learn more about computers has grown. I look forward to building more websites, apps, and potentially even games that are accessible to everyone.</p>
